# This example uses YAML anchors which allows reuse of multiple keys 
# without having to repeat yourself.
# Also see https://github.com/Mic92/dotfiles/blob/master/nixos/.sops.yaml
# for a more complex example.
# Note: Be sure to not include a - before subsequent key types under key_groups
# (i.e. age in the below example should not have a - in front). This will
# otherwise cause sops to require multiple keys (shamir secret sharing)
# to decrypt a secret, which breaks normal sops-nix usage.
keys:
  - &nick EEABC0768AB776CE
creation_rules:
  - path_regex: secrets/[^/]+\.(yaml|json|env|ini)$
    key_groups:

      # age:
      # - *admin_bob
  # creation rule below to support reading from stdin for encryption
  # so that I can pipe buffer contents to sops and automatically en/decrypt in nvim
  # should become unnecesary once sops v3.9.0 is available in nixpkgs
